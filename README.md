## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery

By utilizing HTML, CSS and jQuery, I was able to create a pizza application where the user could build thier own pizza and coose from the toppings given. They can choose from extra cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms or black olives. The user has the option of adding toppings to half of their pizza or the whole pie. When they click on a topping, they can immediately see the changes on their pizza.

## Optimizations

I am still working out some kinks in this app. I'm trying to find a way to align all of my toppings perfectly onto the pizza with the correct margins.

## Lessons Learned:

Relying on JavaScript to do CSS ws new to me, but also allowed this app to work more efficiently. Now I can apply this knowledge to future applications.
